# Sample Diagrams

This repository contains sample architecture and security diagrams. The diagrams are written in Mermaid and render natively in GitHub, VS Code, Notion, Confluence, and other Mermaid-compatible viewers.

## Structure

```
diagrams/
  agentgateway/
    security/       # Security architecture diagrams for AgentGateway Enterprise
```

## Usage

Browse into a product folder and open the `.md` files to view the diagrams. No build step is required — any Markdown viewer with Mermaid support will render them inline.

## Contributing

To add new diagrams, create a subfolder under the relevant product directory and add a Markdown file containing Mermaid code blocks.
